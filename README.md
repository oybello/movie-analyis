This study primarily seeks to compare the movie viewership during festive period (December) to the movie viewership throughout the year. 
The data sets used for the said study are contained in the files: 'genome-scores.csv', 'genone-tags.csv', 'links.csv','movies.csv'. 
These data sets are publicly available for download at: <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>. 
They provide significant information about 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), and a movie recommendation service. 
The data sets contain: 25000095 ratings and 1093360 tag applications across 62423 movies.
By analyzing the said datasets on jupyter notebooks, and obtaining bar charts that depict movie viewing patterns in December only as opposed to the movie viewing patterns throughout the year, 
it was shown that there are similar patterns for movie viewing for the periods under consideration.
